## WDI Admissions Assignment

Congratulations on making it to the second round of the admissions process for Web Development Immersive (WDI) at General Assembly! 

In order to be successful in WDI, you really have to enjoy programming, and the only way to know that for sure is to try it. With that in mind, we’d like you to do some coding before your next interview - when you come in, we'll ask you about your experience with the project, and use it as a launching-off point for further discussion. 

Here is your assignment:

1. Work through the tutorials on [Dash](https://dash.generalassemb.ly/). Please complete **all five projects** – these will teach you some of the basics of using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

2. Begin setting up your own development environment. Watch [this video](http://generalassembly.wistia.com/medias/qzig8mp4mv) to learn how to set up a text editor on your computer and start writing your own HTML, CSS, and Javascript files. 
  
3. Create an account on [GitHub.com](www.github.com) and download the appropriate GitHub client for your operating system ([Mac](http://mac.github.com/) /  [Windows](http://windows.github.com/)). Then, follow the directions [here](http://pages.github.com/) to set up a GitHub Pages repository. Make sure that you <em>clone</em> (copy) the new repository to your desktop!

4. Build a brand new single-page "About Me" website for yourself inside this new repository, using what you learned from Dash about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Your JavaScript code should go inside &lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt; tags inside the &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; section of your HTML file; however, your CSS styling should be implemented through an external style sheet.
Make sure to include:
  - A section telling us more about you, your experience, and your contact information.
  - A picture of you in the center of the page, and two additional images with captions (one placed in the top right of your page, and one place in the bottom left).
  - An image carousel, with at least 3 images, written in JavaScript. Feel free to use outside resources in addition to the Dash tutorial, and don't be afraid to experiment - have fun with it! 
  **DO NOT copy & paste the code.** We expect you to be prepared to talk about the code you've written and explain to us how you approached the problem during the technical portion of the interview. 
  
  **Be sure to create all of the necessary files inside the local copy of your GitHub Pages repository!** As you work, remember to save your files, [add and commit your changes to the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/making-changes#make-a-change), and sync everything back to GitHub.com.

<em>We are not testing your programming aptitude</em>, so don't worry if your code isn't particularly fancy or polished - focus first on making something **simple** that **works**. What we want to see is your intellectual curiosity, resourcefulness, and programming potential; during your interview, we'll use this project as a starting point for a conversation about what you tried, where you got stuck, what you learned along the way, and ways that you'd continue to build out the site in the future.

  (Of course, going above and beyond to impress us certainly won’t hurt...)
  
  
We expect this assignment to take you 10-15 hours. You should be prepared to talk through your code during the interview and share what outside resources you used, if any. If you get stuck, try to get through it on your own. If you’re **really** stuck, Google can help! 

If you have any other questions about the WDI admissions process, please reach out to the producer or admissions officer who's been in touch with you. Good luck!
